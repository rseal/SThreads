Introduction:

This project contains a C++ threading class and Locking mechanisms for

SThread. This implementation was modeled after Java's threading implementation
and uses the pthread library.

Installation:

The complete implementation is provided with header files. Log in as root and
run the install-headers script in the install directory before using.

Dependencies:

To compile programs, make sure and include the -lrt and -lpthread libraries. 

Examples:

See the test program in the examples folder for a simple example summarizing
capabilities.
